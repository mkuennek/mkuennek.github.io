<h2>Hello there</h2>

<p>My name is Michael KÃ¼nneke and I have been working as a professional .NET consultant/software developer over the last decade.</p>

My .NET journey began by working as a student assistant writing automated tests for automotive architecture software while doing my bachelor/master degreen computer science.
During this time I also started working on devops related topics, for example build pipelines and integrating automated quality assessment steps.
I wrote my bachelor's thesis about automated quality assessment of .NET applications.
Part of my master's degree was a one year project group where I learned writing cross platform apps using Xamarin. I was able to use these skills after graduating and working my first job.
In this time container technologies were becoming more and more popular. So I wrote my master's thesis about a 
My main areas of interest are currently .NET and DevOps technologies.
